# MCoinWalletApp

A small app to simulate a BitCoin-esque transmission and storage application.
This was the culmination of an 8 week module in college learning C.

The code works but you'll need a few sample transactions to simulate the actual sending and receiving of transactions.

Disclaimer : I don't usually code in C, I've only used it for 8 weeks so if this seems a bit amateurish, that's because it is.
